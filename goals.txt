Create a “Task Management” application with React + TypeScript (frontend), Node.js (or Nest.js) (backend), and PostgreSQL (database). The application should:

Register (sign up) and Log in (sign in) users.
After logging in, allow users to:
View a list of tasks.
Create a new task.
Update an existing task (e.g., mark complete, edit).
Delete a task.
Focus on correctness, functionality, and code clarity rather than visual design.
This challenge is intended to be completed within ~3 hours, so keep solutions minimal yet functional.
